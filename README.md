# Horiseon-Landing-Page

## Description

This is the main page for the Horiseon Marketing Agency Website. Following accessibility standards, I refactored the original code making it more optimised for search engines with increased accessibility.

Some elements of the code that I changed are:

HTML file:

- Links in the navigation menu are now all linked correctly
- Added 'alt' attribute to images
- Added Semantic Elements
- Improved 'title' element


CSS file:

- Added comments
- Removed unused CSS from the project
- Improved overall organization
